SalesNote is a **desktop app for managing contacts and tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists can get more out of the application 
than from traditional GUI apps. The application and guide are based on AB3 with new added features.

This project is based on the AB3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer.
You may install Java `11` from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
2. Download the latest `SalesNote.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SalesNote.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. 
The app provides some sample data to help you get started.
![Ui](images/UiFirstLaunch.png)
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
e.g. typing **`listtasks`** and pressing Enter will list all tasks.
Some example commands you can try:
   * **`list`**: List all clients.
   * **`add`**`n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/170_80_100 a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 r/loves blue t/friends t/owesMoney`: Adds a client named `John Doe`.
   * **`delete`**`2`: Deletes the 2nd client shown in the current client list.
   * **`clear`**: Deletes all existing data.
   * **`exit`**: Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below to learn more about the commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Amount accepts a real number for its input, with an upper limit of 1 billion, and no negative amounts allowed. Note 
  that it supports accuracy of up to 15-17 decimal places, and accuracy may be lost beyond that point.


* Date inputs should follow one of the formats below.

  Format | Example
  --------|------------------
  **dd mmmm yyyy** | `08 November 2001`
  **dd mmm yyyy** | `08 Nov 2021`
  **yyyy mm dd** | `2021 11 08`
  **dd-mm-yyyy** | `08-11-2021`
  **yyyy/mm/dd** | `2021/11/08`
  **dd/mm/yyyy** | `08/11/2021`

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

## Client Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the client commands:**<br>

* A male's body measurements should be of the format height_waist_shoulder in cm, and it should not be blank.

</div>

### Listing all clients : `listclients`

Shows a list of all clients in the application.

Format: `listclients`

### Adding a client : `addclient`

Allows you to add a client to the application. 

Note that two clients are regarded as their names are the same! As two individuals having the exact same name
is quite a rare occurrence, we felt this was more likely to be a user mistake we wanted to guard against, then
it was to be an intentional choice. If you happen to have two clients with the exact same name, our recommendation
is to add a number, to be clear that this was intentional. (e.g., adding Jane Lim and Jane Lim1).

Format: `addclient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS m/MEASUREMENT g/GENDER [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A client can have any number of tags (including 0). The remark is also optional.
</div>

Examples:
* `addclient n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street Blk 92 g/M m/170_100_40`
* `addclient n/Betsy Crowe e/bcrowe@example.com a/Sesame Street p/1234567 t/important g/F m/160_85_35_81`

### Deleting a client : `deleteclient`

Deletes the specified client from the application.

Format: `deleteclient INDEX`

* Deletes the client at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `listclients` followed by `deleteclient 2` deletes the 2nd client in the application.
* `find Betsy` followed by `deleteclient 1` deletes the 1st client in the results of the `find` command.

### Editing a client : `editclient`

Edits an existing client in the application.

Format: `editclient INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [m/MEASUREMENT] [g/GENDER] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the client’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `editclient 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

### Saving the data

SalesNote data is saved in the hard disk (As a JSON file) automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

SalesNote saves each data in a different json file.
- AddressBook (Clients information) : as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
- TaskBook (Tasks information)  : as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/taskBook.json`.
- OrderBook (Sales order information) : as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/orderBook.json`.

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

_Example usage_

1. Open the JSON file in any of your favorite text editor.
2. Edit the entities in the JSON file as you wish.
3. Re-open SaleNote and changes should be reflected.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, SalesNote will discard all data related to the incorrectly formatted JSON file and start with an empty data file at the next run.</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous SalesNote home folder.
