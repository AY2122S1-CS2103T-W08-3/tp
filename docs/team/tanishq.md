### Project: SalesNote

SalesNote is a desktop application that helps tailors to manage sales and keep track of a smaller, but more recurrent group of clients. 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). 
It has about 20k lines of code written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
